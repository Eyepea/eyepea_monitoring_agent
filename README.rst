Overview
--------

To monitor the servers with Shinken, Nagios or Icinga, system administrators usually configure active checks of the monitored servers.
It means the monitoring system must have a direct network access to the monitored server.

With **Eyepea monitoring agent**, this model is reverted, it does passive checks of your monitored servers.
You don't need to open an access from your monitoring system to the monitored servers.

The main use case of this tool is to monitor distant servers in a complex network where you can't connect directly for security reasons, typically with a large client.
You need only to open **NSCA** or **HTTP(S)** port from the monitored server to the monitoring system.

Technical details
`````````````````

The behaviour of this tool is simple:

.. image:: http://files.eyepea.eu/monitoring/schema.png

#. The program is started by cron.

#. It retrieves monitoring data **(1)** from **nagios-plugins**.

#. Finally, it pushes the data **(2)** via **NSCA** (Shinken, Nagios, Icinga) or **HTTP(S)** (Shinken) to the monitoring server.

#. (**WS-Shinken only**) If the connexion between the monitored server and the monitoring system is broken, data is kept in a cache file, to be re-send the next run.

**Warning:** WS-Shinken support isn't finished, it will be available for 1.0.

How to install ?
----------------

Debian packages is the prefered method.
If you use another distribution, you can use the Python package or contribute to publish a package for your distribution.

Debian
``````

We are working to propose clean Debian packages, a first version exists in the **debian/** folder.

**Warning:** Root rights are necessary to install config files and cron file.
pip install eyepea-monitoring-agent

Usage
-----

- Default config files location: **/etc/eyepea_monitoring_agent/**
- Default cron file location: **/etc/cron.d/**

#. Configure passive checks on your monitoring system:

   #. `Shinken <http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/wiki/nsca_daemon_module>`_

   #. (PDF) `Nagios <http://nagios.sourceforge.net/download/contrib/documentation/misc/NSCA_Setup.pdf>`_

   #. `Icinga <https://wiki.icinga.org/display/howtos/Setting+up+NSCA+with+Icinga>`_

#. Configure the nagios plugins you want to use in **nagios_plugins.cfg**:

   #. Define the nagios plugins path with the **path** option in **[default_settings]** section.

   #. The name of each section is the nagios plugin command.

   #. Each setting is a CLI option of the nagios plugin.

#. Fill in the credidentials for your monitoring system in **nsca.cfg** or **ws_shinken.cfg**.

#. Adapt the checks frequency in: **/etc/cron.d/eyepea_monitoring_agent**.

CLI options
-----------

Launch: **eyepea_monitoring_agent --help**
You can override the location of each config file with a CLI parameter.

Debug
-----

By default, it uses cron syslog and console for the logs.
You can customize this behaviour in **logging.ini**: http://docs.python.org/library/logging.config.html#configuration-file-format
